## Sharpe Ratio Issues and Solutions

### The Problem
The current Sharpe ratio calculations show unrealistic values (6.44, 21.10) because:

1. **Using Trade Returns Instead of Daily Returns**: The system calculates Sharpe ratio from individual trade returns rather than daily portfolio returns
2. **Incorrect Annualization**: The √252 factor assumes daily returns, but we're using trade returns
3. **Missing Time Periods**: Not accounting for periods when the portfolio is in cash

### Example of the Issue
- Trade returns: [44%, -10%, -9%, 4%, 54%, -15%]
- Current calculation: Uses these 6 values directly
- **Result**: Sharpe ratio of 6.44 (unrealistic)

### Realistic Sharpe Ratios
- **Excellent**: 2.0+
- **Good**: 1.0-2.0
- **Acceptable**: 0.5-1.0
- **Poor**: <0.5

### The Fix Applied
```python
# Convert trade returns to approximate daily returns
daily_trade_returns = [r / trade['duration_days'] for r, trade in zip(returns, trades)]
```

This provides more realistic Sharpe ratios but is still an approximation.

### Proper Solution (Future Enhancement)
Calculate true daily portfolio returns:
1. Track portfolio value each day
2. Account for cash positions between trades
3. Calculate daily returns from portfolio value changes
4. Use these for Sharpe ratio calculation

## Bollinger Bands Strategy Performance

### Why Low Trade Count?
Bollinger Bands strategies typically generate few trades because:

1. **Statistical Nature**: Bands contain ~95% of price action
2. **Rare Events**: Price touches bands only ~5% of the time
3. **Mean Reversion**: Prices quickly return to middle band

### Strategy Logic
- **Buy Signal**: Price < Lower Band (oversold)
- **Sell Signal**: Price > Upper Band (overbought)

### Performance Expectations
- **Few Trades**: 1-5 trades per year is normal
- **High Win Rate**: Mean reversion strategies often have 60-80% win rate
- **Risk Management**: Important due to occasional large losses

### Results Summary
- **AAPL 2023**: 2 trades, 15.07% return, 100% win rate
- **Strategy vs Buy-Hold**: 15.07% vs 53.94% (buy-hold better)
- **Risk-Adjusted**: Lower volatility but lower returns

## System Status
✅ **Bollinger Bands Working**: Now generating trades properly  
✅ **All Strategies Functional**: RSI, MACD, Momentum, Moving Average, Bollinger Bands  
⚠️ **Sharpe Ratio**: Improved but still approximate - shows realistic ranges now  
✅ **Trade Display**: Frontend showing all trade details correctly
